Synchronicity simulation system demo

System Architecture Overview

The proposed Synchronicity Simulation System is a lightweight, modular engine that orchestrates all NPCs, world state, and AI-driven narrative in a 2D top-down RPG.  The core idea is a central orchestration layer (“Synchronicity Engine”) that continuously advances simulated time, updates each NPC’s routine, and checks for story triggers. NPCs live out daily schedules based on their personality and goals, but may deviate for emergent events. The Synchronicity Engine ties together:

NPC Design Module (personality, backstory, schedules/aspirations)

World Simulation Module (time, environment state, NPC interactions)

Event/Quest Generation Module (AI-driven dynamic story creation)

AI/NLP Interface (local LLM or prompt system for narrative generation)

Gameplay/UI Layer (player input, 2D rendering)


Each module is loosely coupled.  The engine updates NPC states and world state on each tick, invokes the Event Generator when conditions or player actions warrant, and feeds responses back into the game.  This design allows emergent narrative: instead of a fixed script, quests and dramas are generated on the fly based on simulated context.

NPC Design

Each NPC is defined by personality archetype, dynamic background, and aspirations/needs.  For example, an NPC might be “brave and vengeful”, with a family (dynamic relationships) and occupation (e.g. farmer, guard).  These attributes influence behavior and decisions:

Personality: Each NPC has traits (e.g. brave, cowardly, vengeful, compassionate). These biases affect dialogue choices and action priorities.  For example, a cowardly NPC will avoid conflicts and may spread rumors rather than fight. Personality can be inspired by social simulations like CiF-CK, which uses persistent social traits and goals to drive NPC reasoning.

Background: A simple character profile (family ties, job, status). This adds story hooks (e.g. a sheriff NPC has subordinate deputies; a tavern owner has rumors from customers).  Background context can seed personal side-quests or motivations (e.g. “help my sick child” if family is sick).  These details can be stored as text or data attributes.

Aspirations and Needs: Similar to The Sims, each NPC has long-term goals (e.g. ambition to become mayor, or to avenge a rival) and short-term needs (hunger, safety). Aspirations dynamically generate personal objectives. For instance, an aspiring hero archetype may periodically spawn a quest “hunt the ogre” to fulfill their heroism goal.

Schedules and Daily Routines: NPCs follow a schedule (work, eat, socialize) but can be interrupted.  The simulation tracks each NPC’s current action.  Routine life (sleep at night, work during day, visit tavern) provides predictable structure, while synchronic events can break the routine. For example, a traveling merchant NPC might normally move on a route, but if ambushed (drama event) will change behavior.


Generative agent research shows that even simple daily routines and memory can make NPCs feel alive.  In our design, NPCs log key experiences (e.g. player interactions or family news) in memory. This record can be used to adapt future behavior or dialogue (see AI Interface). In summary, each NPC is a mini agent with static traits and a dynamic story state.  The engine updates NPC “beliefs” (relationships, mood) through simulation of social exchanges.

World Simulation

The world simulation provides the context for NPC interactions and emergent drama. Key aspects include:

Environment & Time: A day-night cycle, weather, and locations. Shops open/close, people gather at inns or markets. Time can trigger events (e.g. nightly monsters, weekly market day).

NPC Mobility and Interactions: NPCs move between locations per schedule (home, work, social spots). When two NPCs share space, they might converse or conflict. Social dynamics (romance, rivalry) play out spontaneously.  For instance, if two NPCs are rivals, their interactions might trigger gossip or fights.

Local Events and Rumors: Minor incidents (pickpocket, brawl) can spawn rumors that spread. The system might propagate rumors via NPC-to-NPC chat. This can organically lead players into quests (“Bandits attacked my friend” heard in tavern).

Small-Town Drama vs Adventure Drama: The simulation maintains both social drama and adventure hooks. Small-town drama (betrayals, romances, rivalries) emerges from NPC traits and histories. Adventure drama (bandit raids, monster sightings, treasure rumors) can be triggered randomly or by NPC aspirations (e.g. a hungry NPC might search for food in dangerous caves, creating an incidental “monster hunt” quest).

Economy & Resources: Simple economy (gold, goods) and resources (ammo, food) can exist to motivate quests (bounties, delivery tasks).


Importantly, the world state is shared by all modules: when an NPC leaves the tavern with a stolen item, that item’s absence and the NPC’s guilt might eventually become a story beat.  Techniques like multi-agent planning can be used to ensure scalability: for example, Magnenat et al.’s MCTS framework lets many agents plan in parallel. A lightweight simulation can approximate emergent behavior by running simple rules for each NPC (e.g. “if rival insults me, increase anger, possibly initiate fight later”).

Event / Quest Generation

The heart of emergent narrative is the dynamic quest generator. Rather than fixed quests, the system uses an AI/NLP model to weave stories that fit current simulation state. The workflow is:

1. Trigger Detection: The orchestration layer monitors for conditions or player actions that warrant a quest. Triggers include: player visiting the bounty board, overhearing a conversation, completing a minor task, or simply wandering into a conflict scene. Also, NPCs might internally trigger quests (an NPC decides to seek revenge or honor a desire).


2. Context Gathering: When triggered, the system collects relevant context: the initiating NPC’s traits/backstory, involved NPCs, location, current world state, and the player’s recent actions or reputation. For example, if the cowardly NPC Millie has a thieving brother who was hurt, context might include “Millie (personality: cowardly, vengeful; occupation: tavern cook) is distressed because her brother was attacked by orcs at the bridge.”


3. AI Prompting / Planning: Using that context, the system invokes the AI model (via local inference or prompt to a service) to generate a quest description and steps. The prompt is engineered (“smart prompting”) to elicit coherent output. For instance: “Millie is a frightened cook. She asks the player: ‘Please, I need you to avenge my brother! A monstrous orc wounded him on the bridge outside town.’ The LLM might respond with a structured quest: “Objective: Rescue Millie’s brother / Defeat the orcs at the bridge / Return for reward.” This uses narrative planning akin to combining automated planning and story arcs.


4. Quest Realization: The generated quest is instantiated in-game: markers (e.g. on mini-map), NPC dialogue lines are set, and internal quest state is created. Reward and fail conditions are defined (e.g. rescue = success, let brother die = failure or alternate).


5. Dramatic Incidents: Beyond quests, the system can inject story events. For example, an NPC wedding may break into a brawl (scripted by AI: “the drunk rival crashes the ceremony!”). These incidents are also generated contextually.



Notably, using an LLM (or other generative model) instead of fixed templates yields more variety and coherence.  Earlier dynamic quest systems often used templates or planning graphs (e.g. quest templates to ensure tasks make sense, or combining genetic algorithms with planners). In contrast, here the LLM synthesizes narrative text on demand, “filling in the blanks” with world-specific details. This avoids the combinatorial explosion of designing all possible storylines by hand. As Peng et al. note, LLM-driven NPCs can produce rich emergent narratives and “greater flexibility in players’ interactions” compared to rigid scripts.

Key benefits: The quest generator can create side-quests tailored to any NPC based on their current situation. For instance, if two NPCs fall in love, the AI might generate a kidnapping plot by jealous rivals. Or a rumor heard could trigger an unexplored dungeon. Because generation is on-the-fly, even rare or unusual scenarios can appear, improving replay value.

Orchestration Layer (Synchronicity Engine)

At the top, the Synchronicity Engine integrates everything. Its responsibilities include:

Time-stepping: Advance game time in ticks or hours. On each tick, update NPC schedules (who moves where), handle timed events (shop opens), and decay/raise NPC needs (e.g. hunger).

State Management: Maintain the global game state (NPC statuses, quest flags, world variables). This central database is queried by other modules.

Event Coordination: Detect when conditions meet triggers. For instance, if it’s night and monster threat level is high, spawn a bandit raid quest. Or if player talked to Sheriff and then patrol found evidence, unlock a detective storyline.

Conflict Resolution: Ensure conflicting quests don’t break coherence. The engine may enforce minimal coherence rules (e.g. an orc hunt quest and a bandit raid shouldn’t spawn at the exact same time in same location unless narrated).

Resource Efficiency: Since hardware is limited, the engine prunes or limits simultaneous events (e.g. max 2-3 active quests at once per region).

Randomness vs Design: It balances randomness with narrative plausibility. Some randomness ensures surprise, but many quests follow plausible arcs (thanks to AI guidance).


This orchestration is lightweight: it can be implemented in a game loop that checks a few conditions each frame or second. It coordinates NPC actions and the AI module but does not perform heavy computation itself. In practice, emergent narrative frameworks like CiF-CK show that a social state machine can run on consoles, and our engine is simpler, aimed at a 40-NPC small town, so it is very manageable.

AI / NLP Interface

The AI interface is how the system invokes language models. Two approaches are considered:

Local Lightweight Models: Modern compressed LLMs (e.g. TinyLlama, Phi-3 Mini, Google’s Gemma-2B) can run on a standard desktop/mobile CPU. These models can generate dialogue or quest text without cloud access. We would embed a small model (2–4B parameters) in the game binary. Pros: runs offline, no latency after initial load, no API costs. Cons: less fluent output, limited context window. To mitigate, we would use smart prompting and possibly fine-tune on the game’s lore or a small story dataset. We might also use a retrieval mechanism: for example, key NPC memory or world knowledge can be inserted into prompts to ground the model (a simple form of RAG).

Prompting / Hybrid AI: Alternatively, the game could use a remote API (if always-online is acceptable). A small local model could handle routine chatter, while a higher-quality model (e.g. GPT-family or Claude) is queried for major quests.  Smart prompt engineering (prewritten templates with slots filled by context) can guide the model to produce consistent world-specific stories. This “prompt-as-rulebook” approach means the AI’s creativity is channeled by the prompt structure. Modern trends support this hybrid approach: lightweight on-device models for speed and privacy, with cloud-based models for bursty heavy tasks.


In either case, each generative call is relatively brief (one NPC request → one quest narrative). By keeping prompts concise and reusing context (cached NPC summaries), the overhead stays low. For a proof-of-concept, even GPT-4 Turbo could be used via API, but on-device models ensure the prototype runs on basic hardware. As the ODSC review notes, “the rise of lightweight LLMs” enables powerful AI agents on personal devices.

Modular Breakdown

Putting it together, the system has clear modules:

NPC System: Data structures for NPC profiles, plus an update function each tick. Personality influences decision weights; background data seeds dialog prompts; aspirations drive internal goals. NPCs log events in a lightweight memory store (text snippets or flags) to inform future AI prompts.

World Simulation: Maintains a grid or graph of locations (town square, mine, forest) and global variables (weather, day). It updates NPC positions and environmental effects. Simple rules (if it rains, fewer NPCs go out; if guards are weak, crime goes up) keep world dynamic.

Event/Quest Generator: The AI driver. On trigger, it packages context and sends it to the AI model, then parses the response into game actions (spawn monster units, set quest objectives, attach dialog to NPC). It uses “story templates” under the hood (e.g. [Hook] + [Tasks] + [Reward] structure) but the content is generated dynamically.

Orchestration Layer: The core loop and logic that binds modules. It decides when to call the quest generator, routes player inputs to the right NPC or UI element, and enforces global rules. It keeps runtime tasks minimal (no heavy search loops) so it runs smoothly on modest CPUs.

AI Interface Module: Abstracts away the details of calling the language model. It might include a local inference engine or a REST-like client for a remote model. It also handles prompt construction and caching.


A high-level diagram (Figure 1) would show data flow: the Player and UI feed inputs into the Orchestration, which consults NPC and World modules. When a quest is needed, the Event Generator queries the AI Interface, which returns narrative text to be realized in-game.

Proof-of-Concept Focus

For a working demo, the emphasis is on scope over scale. About 30–40 NPCs is enough to show rich interactions (note the generative agents paper simulated 25 convincingly). The town can be small (e.g. a village + immediate outskirts), and the number of parallel quests limited. Each NPC can have 2–3 background facts and 1–2 traits. We would create a few example aspirations (e.g. “protect town”, “find lost relic”, “win mayoral election”) that can drive story triggers.

By keeping art simple (2D sprites, few animations) and AI inference light, the prototype runs on typical desktops or even tablets. The modular design means each piece can be tested separately: for example, run the world/NPC sim with canned events before hooking up the AI. Using open-source or easily downloadable models (e.g. Llama 2 4B) and widely-used game frameworks (Unity, Godot) will speed development.

In summary, this architecture leverages modern generative AI in a structured simulation. NPCs behave as fully-fledged characters (inspired by Generative Agents), the world evolves naturally, and quests arise organically from the interplay of character and player action. By combining agent simulation research and on-device LLMs, we create a small-scale but highly immersive proof-of-concept that demonstrates emergent narrative in a lightweight 2D RPG.
